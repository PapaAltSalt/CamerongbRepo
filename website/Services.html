		<h6>Album Art</h6>
			
		<p3>I've created a number of pieces for album art for artists that I have know personally. The styles can vary and are dependent on the sound and vision that the artist wants for the album. If you are interested in seeing the album art I have created so far, feel free to check out the 'Portfolio page'.</p3>

		<h6>Photography</h6>
		
		<p3>I originally started doing photography as a course at A Level but have now taken it forward as a hobby when I go out. The entire process from location scouting to editing the best shots is enjoyable to me, though I lean towards the editing side as a service that I can provide. Feel free to look through the 'Portfolio page' to see some of my work.</p3>

		<h6>Digital Art</h6>
			
		<p3>I have dabbled in the odd piece of digital art after being introduced to it in my Games Design course. I am always trying to improve my skills as well as learn new styles and techniques to make my workflow more productive. Though there aren't many examples of my digital art in my portfolio feel free to check them out.</p3>

		<h6>Posters</h6>
		
		<p3>Much like my digital art I have only recently started creating posters and it was again thanks to my Games Design course for allowing me to hone my Photoshop skills and find a love for all things graphic design. If you are interested in seeing what I have created so far check out the 'Portfolio page'.</p3>
