<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> 
	

Hello and welcome to my website, here you will be able to find out about me, what I can do and what my plans are for the future.

		</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
		
<p>
My previous studies at A Level where in Art and Photography, in which the skills I learned have stuck with me. I find them extremely useful in my more recent studies as well as a hobby outside of the classroom. 

		</p>
		
<p>

My most recent studies at Mid Kent College in Games Design have also taught me valuable skills as well as reinforcing the skills I had learned previously. 3D modeling, Level design, Concept art and Pre Project Planning skills such as creating Games Design Documents. I will be continuing these studies at degree level at Bournemouth University with the hopes of then graduating and getting a job in the games industry.

		</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>
In the Portfolio tab you will be able to find all my best work so far and have a look through. For a few I talk about my process and the challenges I faced along the way. In the Services tab you will be able to find my CV along with the things I can do. Lastly in the Contact tab you will find information on how to contact me if you are interested in working with or hiring me for a project.
