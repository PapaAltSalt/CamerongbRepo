		<p> About Me

Hello and welcome to my website, here you will be able to find out about me, what I can do and what my plans are for the future.

​

Education

My previous studies at A Level where in Art and Photography, in which the skills I learned have stuck with me. I find them extremely useful in my more recent studies as well as a hobby outside of the classroom. 

​

My current studies at Mid Kent College in Games Design have also taught me valuable skills as well as reinforcing the skills I had learned previously. 3D modeling, Level design, Concept art and Pre Project Planning skills such as creating Games Design Documents. I will be continuing these studies at degree level at Bournemouth University with the hopes of then graduating and getting a job in the games industry.
